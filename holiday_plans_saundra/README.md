# Holiday Plans Project

## Overview  
It's November, and everyone is planning their holiday vacation. But management is struggling! They need a solution to approve vacation requests while also ensuring that there are still enough employees in the office to achieve end-of-year goals.

Your task is to build one HTTP API that allows employees to make vacation requests, and another that provides managers with an overview of all vacation requests and allows them to decline or approve requests.
